### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 15+ years experienced software engineer. My Background is in Java and Spring and other complimentary technologies. At my job, I am currently working on developing Java/Spring Azure functions. I have recently been experimenting with developing Spring Boot 3.0 Azure functions. Also, on the side, I am learning to develop React JS web applications.

- âš¡ Fun fact:  My profile icon is my dog 'Crush', adopted from Midwest Pug Rescue. I adopted him at age 5 and he lived to 15 1/2 years old. Anyone looking for a family pet, I highly recommend adopting rescues. There are many good pets out there looking for a place to call home.
