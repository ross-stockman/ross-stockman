### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 15+ years experienced software engineer. My Background is in Java and Spring and other complimentary technologies. At my job, I am currently working on developing Java/Spring Azure functions. I have recently been experimenting with developing Spring Boot 3.3 Azure functions using Java 21 preview. Also, on the side, I am always interested in learning different design principles and philosophies, such as SOLID vs CUPID, TDD, DDD, etc.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Spring Boot and Azure Functions
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Domain Driven Design and Test Driven Development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Spring Boot 3.3 Azure Functions
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning React JS for developing simple front end web applications

- âš¡ Fun fact:  My profile icon is my dog 'Crush', adopted from Midwest Pug Rescue. I adopted him at age 5 and he lived to 15 1/2 years old. Anyone looking for a family pet, I highly recommend adopting rescues. There are many good pets out there looking for a place to call home.
