### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with over 15 years of experience, specializing in Java and Spring frameworks along with complementary technologies. Currently, I am focused on developing Java/Spring Azure functions. Recently, I have been experimenting with Spring Boot 3.3 Azure functions using Java 21 preview. Additionally, I am passionate about exploring various design principles and philosophies, including SOLID vs. CUPID, TDD, and DDD. I am also interested in utilizing AI tools to assist with software development, testing, and reviewing my work and collaborating with peers.
