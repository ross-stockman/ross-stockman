🔧 Full-stack engineer • ☕ Coffee-fueled problem solver • 🐾 Rescue dog advocate

### Hi there 👋

I'm a **full-stack software engineer** with over 18 years of experience, specializing in Java and the Spring ecosystem. I enjoy building scalable systems and working across the stack—from designing resilient backend services to experimenting with modern frontend frameworks like React.

Lately, I've been exploring AI tools and Model-Control-Prompt (MCP) patterns to better understand how AI can enhance real-world software systems. I’m passionate about software architecture principles and philosophies, such as SOLID vs. CUPID, TDD, and DDD. I believe in leveraging modern tools—such as AI-assisted development—to improve code quality, testing, and collaboration.
