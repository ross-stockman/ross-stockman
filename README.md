### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer with over 18 years of experience, specializing in Java and the Spring ecosystem. I enjoy working across the stack and am currently expanding my skills in front-end development with React. Lately, I've been experimenting with AI tools and Model-Control-Prompt (MCP) patterns to explore their potential in real-world applications.

I'm also passionate about architecture principles and philosophies, such as SOLID vs. CUPID, TDD, and DDD. I believe in leveraging modern tools—including AI—to enhance software development, testing, and team collaboration.
